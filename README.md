# react-coding-test

As a chemistry company we absolutely love Breaking Bad! But there are so many characters, we can't keep track anymore so you will help us by developing a simple web application that lets us search and sort all the breaking bad characters. 

[Here you can see how the app should look and what it should do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4-sGOxdaso&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=BorealisDigitalStudio)

## Requirements

- Implement the features that are shown in the video
- Use the provided React starter code, relax it's just the default TypeScript Create React App
- Use the [Breaking Bad API](https://breakingbadapi.com/) to get the character data
- Use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) as much as possible
- Use our [custom Material UI theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poc-material-ui-theme) to Borealize your components
- For the rest you are free to do whatever you want, feel free to add a testing framework of your choice
- Consider adding a dockerfile to containerize the application

## Uploading
